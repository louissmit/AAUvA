In this assignment, a new internal state representation is implemented. Instead of using the old state representation wherine the absolute positions of both the predator and the prey are stored, this new representation only holds the distance between the predator and the prey, expressed as a tuple of the horizontal distance and the vertical distance. This representation is possible without violating the Markov property due to the toroidal nature of the board. \\

The new state representation has important consequences for the size of the state space. In the old representation, both the predator and the prey could be in one of $11 \times 11$ locations, amounting for a total of $11 \times 11 \times 11 \times 11 = 14641$ states. In the new representation, the distance between predator and prey can be represented as one of $11 \times 11 = 121$ states, reducing the state space by a factor $121$.
