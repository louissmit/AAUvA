
Value Iteration algorithm was implemented. This algorithm does not use any policy at all but calculates values for each state with the following formula \\


\begin{math}
  V(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^a \left[\mathcal{R}_{ss'}^a + \gamma V(s') \right]
\end{math} \\

This algorithm loops over all states updating values of states until the difference between new value and old value is less than threshold for all states. At the end the optimal policy is created according to the formula: \\


\begin{math}
V(s) =\arg\max_a \sum_{s'} \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^a \left[\mathcal{R}_{ss'}^a + \gamma V(s') \right]
\end{math} \\
