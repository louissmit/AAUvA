Iterative policy evaluation was implemented for the randomly moving predator. This algorithm takes a predator policy as input and produces a value for each possible state which is calculated according to the following formula: \\

\begin{math}
  V(s) = \sum_a \pi (s, a) \sum_{s'} \mathcal{P}_{ss'}^a \left[\mathcal{R}_{ss'}^a + \gamma V(s') \right]
\end{math} \\

This algorithm loops over all states until it finds that the difference between the previous value for $V(s)$ and the updated value is less than a certain threshold for all states. In the case of this specific implementation, a threshold of 0.0001 was used.
